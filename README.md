# Cinema films APP

Here is the first version of the first complete app developed with Flutter and Dart.

## Project description

It shows the movies that are currently in cinemas, and below, the most popular ones. By clicking on any of the films we will obtain it's information such as the original title, the average score, the synopsis... and also, the list of actors and actresses that appear in it.

There is also the search functionality, so any movie can be found and access to it's data.

All this information is possible thanks to TheMovieDB API.

## Technical functionalities

All what I have used for this app:
